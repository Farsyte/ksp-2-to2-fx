TO2 low level tinkering

I'm a big fan of Kerbal Space Program, and because I like to tinker
around with autopilot code, an equally big fan of the k-OS mod. Recently,
the sequel, Kerbal Space Program 2, was placed into Early Access, and
the KontrolSystem2 mod has been released.

see https://github.com/untoldwind/KontrolSystem2

So, *OF COURSE* I am going to install his mod, and start tinkering with
it at the lowest level possible. I want to actually construct my own take
on some of the facilities Untoldwind has provided in his standard library,
where my approach may be better, or worse, but is likely to be at least
a bit different.

My goal (as with my KSP-1 k-OS tinkering) is to achieve smooth and
repeatable automated missions.
